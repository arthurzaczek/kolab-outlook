For compiling this project you need the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb398242.aspx Visual Studio Office Tools], which are part of Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition (and others), the [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=54EB3A5A-0E52-40F9-A2D1-EECD7A092DCB&displaylang=en VSTO runtime v3.0], and the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kh3965hw.aspx Primary Interop Assemblies] for Office 2007.

If you want to setup a build server without installing VS2008 there, you can use the included BuildDependenciesInstaller project to package all necessary DLLs from a developer machine into an MSI for the build server. See the included README.txt for details.
